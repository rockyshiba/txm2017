                        <p>"I grew up with a lot of insecurities, a lot of self esteem issues. When I got into drugs and alcohol my life took a downward spiral. I ended up in a couple of dark places – on the streets and in jail. But in jail I started to lift weights. It was the first thing that made me feel good about myself. I went to college to become a personal trainer because I wanted to give other people that feeling. Since then I created One Academy- a group of like-minded people who came together to challenge ourselves, set goals, and overcome obstacles. I want to give people a family. I want to give people a team. Everyone has a different kind of strength: emotional, physical, and mental. One Academy taps into those strengths. We’re encouraging people to try something they’ve never done before. It’s an empowering experience inspiring other people."</p>

<!--<p class="profile-description">"I’ve always been into athletics. When I entered high school I wanted to become an athletic therapist or a trainer. I played competitive soccer and lacrosse throughout high school. But when I was 18, I injured my knee in soccer. I had two knee surgeries. It was my first year of university. I put on some weight because I wasn’t as active as I wanted to be. I battled an anxiety disorder and depression. Physical activity was how I managed everything. I wanted to be a personal trainer because I want to help people live their ideal life. I would like people to live a long, healthy, and independent life. And it’s not that hard. You don’t have to be an athlete. You just have to move a bit."</p>-->
