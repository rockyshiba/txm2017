                                    therapist or a trainer. I played competitive soccer and lacrosse throughout high school.
                                    But when I was 18, I injured my knee in soccer. I had two knee surgeries. It was my first
                                    year of university. I put on some weight because I wasn’t as active as I wanted to be.
                                    I battled an anxiety disorder and depression. Physical activity was how I managed everything.
                                    I wanted to be a personal trainer because I want to help people live their ideal life.
                                    I would like people to live a long, healthy, and independent life. And it’s not that
                                    hard. You don’t have to be an athlete. You just have to move a bit."</p>
